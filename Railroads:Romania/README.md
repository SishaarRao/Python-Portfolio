# A* Search Implemented on Railroads Across the U.S.

This program is a demonstration of the A* Search implemented to the railroad maps across the U.S.

### How to Run
To run the simulation, run the file *railroad_Torbert_1_2017srao.py* and enter any city from the list as your starting point and another city as your destination. It will then use the A* search to calculate the shortest path there.
