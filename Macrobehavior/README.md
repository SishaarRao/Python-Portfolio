# Macrobehavior

This program is a simple demonstration of the Macrobehavior concept demonstrated in [On Letting a Computer Help with the Work by Thomas Schelling.](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/15/4/9/Schelling_Th_C_1972._On_Letting_a_Computer_Help_with_the_Work._JASSS.pdf) In this paper, he describes a macroscopic model describing residential segregation.

He assumes that individuals of a certain race gain more happiness when surrounded by individuals of the same race, and therefore, if left to randomness where individuals can swap their home for a random one, and will continue to do so until they have reached some level of happiness, then what you will observe is segregation.

While the morals of this argument may be questionable, and while I certainly do not agree with his statements, this paper nonetheless was influential in the development of computing systems as a means of modeling macroscopic behavior. As a result, this project is a demonstration of what he described.
